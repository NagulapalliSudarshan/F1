            <h2> Oracle Red Bull Racing</h2><br>
            <p>Red Bull Racing came into existence late in 2004 with ambitions to challenge for race victories and world championship titles. Christian Horner was appointed team principal soon after and has guided the development of the team ever since.</p>
            <p>This was not the work of a moment. Over the next four seasons, solid foundations were laid. The team recruited in both quantity and quality, steadily expanding until it was capable of going toe-to-toe with the most illustrious names in racing.</p>
            <p>The team finished comfortably mid-table in 2005 and 2006. The initial driver line-up mixed youth and experience: David Coulthard provided the latter, while Christian Klien, Vitantonio Liuzzi and Robert Doornbos were the former. DC scored our first podium, finishing third at the 2006 Monaco Grand Prix.For 2007, Mark Webber came onboard to join DC. The team finished fifth that year but dropped back to seventh again in 2008, although everything was going to change in 2009.</p>

            <h2>McLaren Racing</h2><br>
            <p>The McLaren F1 is a supercar designed and manufactured by McLaren Automotive, the same guys that run that incredibly successful Formula 1 team. Originally a concept conceived by Gordon Murray, he convinced Ron Dennis to back the project and engaged Peter Stevens to design the exterior of the car.</p>
            <p>The McLaren F1 was a clean-sheet design, with all components except the tail lamps built specifically for it. The guiding principle was efficiency. Thus it is compact, with body panels and understructure of featherweight carbon fiber, and virtually every mechanical component of aluminum or magnesium. The obsession with weight was the stuff of legend. The Kenwood stereo, the air conditioning and the gold-plated titanium tools were all designed by their manufacturers to specific weight specifications that Murray has asked for. Completely customized for the F1 and so light that most parts manufacturers at the time were not sure they could meet the targets.</p>

            <h2>Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant </h2><br>
            <p>Aston Martin is a British car manufacturer that has participated in Formula One in various forms and is currently racing in F1 under the Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team name. The company first participated in Formula One during the 1959 season where they debuted the DBR4 chassis using their own engine but it failed to score any points. They continued to perform poorly through the 1960 season, once again failing to score any points. As a result, Aston Martin decided to leave Formula One after 1960.</p>
            <p>A commercial rebranding of Racing Point F1 Team resulted in the team's return as Aston Martin in 2021, utilising Mercedes power units. The team, owned by Lawrence Stroll, has Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll as their race drivers beginning with the 2023 season. The team is headquartered in Silverstone.</p>
            <p>Most people don’t know that the F1 had a great racing history. The 220-mph GTR competition version took first, third, fourth, and fifth overall against a slew of purpose-built racers and did so almost immediately after launching. It blew the competition away. When production of the F1 ended in 1998, McLaren had given the world seven prototypes, seventy-two street-legal examples, and twenty-eight full-on race versions. The Sultan of Brunei owns eight or so, and untold numbers have been destroyed at the hands of over-exuberant owners.</p>

            <p>Williams is a well respected name in Formula One as they impressed many with their impressively efficient racing cars. The team quickly rose to the top after its debut and simply dominated the sport through the 1990. Fortunes though were not always so good.</p>
            <p>Frank Williams entered Formula 1 as a private entrant in 1969 but it was not until 1977 that the current team began to take shape. Things really got moving when Frank joined forces with talented designer Patrick Head and managed to secure major backing from Saudia airlines. The duo set up a factory in Didcot where Head penned the stunning Williams FW07. Clay Regazzoni scored the teams first win, fittingly on home soil. Four further wins from Australian Alan Jones completed a successful year that left the team second in the constructors' championship.</p>
